# Taylor-Swift-Final-Project
This is my final project for my social statistics course where I analyzed Taylor Swift songs. I looked at song duration, tone, genre, and popularity.
## Instructions 
To access and utilize the script, open the "final_project_script.R" file, which contains the code for my findings. To access the dataset, open the "STA215_Dataset - Sheet1 (1).csv" file. 

## **Data**
The data used for the analyses was gathering samples of the finalized original songs from Taylor Swift's 9 albums. I used her Taylor's Version copies. Not every album was used as it was a random sample. The question being asked was what variables play a role in Taylor Swift songs and how it relates to its popularity. The unit of analysis is one song and 30 observations were collected. The type of sampling strategy that was used was convenience sampling. 

I gathered this data by randomly sampling 30 songs. I then checked each song to record its duration. I listened to each song and personally determined the tone and genre (as well as some research for genre). To figure out the song's popularity I used a website. 

## **Operationalization**
The concept of mood and attitude conveyed in songs relating to Taylor Swift songs was operationalized by using a qualitative coding scheme named tone. I would use 4 descriptive words and categorize each song accordingly. The song would be categorized as happy if it had upbeat lyrics and beats. The song would be categorized as angry if the lyrics and beat were mad and showed signs of rage. The song would be categorized as sad if the mood and voice was low and the lyrics were upsetting. The song would be categorized as mournful if it had lyrics and a tone of longing for something no longer had, as well as signs of regret. 

The concept of classification of songs relating to Taylor Swift songs was operationalized by using a qualitative coding scheme named genre. I would use 4 descriptive words and categorize each song accordingly. The song would be categorized as a folk song if it had a storytelling nature. The song would be categorized into country if it has storytelling elements with beats such as the fiddle and banjo. The song would be categorized into pop if it has an upbeat tempo with catchy melodies. The song would be categorized into alternative rock if it had rock-like features but more melodic and experimental. 

The concept of length of each song relating to Taylor Swift songs was operationalized by using a quantitative variable named song duration, where songs were measured on a minute scale from 2.27-10.13. Songs that were closer to 2 had a shorter length and songs closer to 10 had a longer length.

The concept of engagement with a song relating to Taylor Swift songs was operationalized by using a quantitative variable named popularity, where songs were measured on a stream scale from 12,895,010-1,175,236,934. Songs that were closer to 12,000,000 had less popularity and songs closer to 1,000,000,000 had a higher popularity.
